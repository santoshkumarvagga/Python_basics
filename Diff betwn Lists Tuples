Lists - Mutable. Once declared, can add/delete/modify elements from Lists. i,e. Dynamic in nature.
Tuples - Immutable. Once declared, no further adding/deleting/modifying elements from tuple. i,e. Static in nature

Lists - Consume more memory, hence accessiblility is slower comapered to lists.
Tuples - Consume less memory

Lists - have many built-in methods to be called on lists like len(), append(), insert(), extend(),sum(), count(), index(), min(), max(), reverse(), pop(), del(), remove(), etc
Tuples - have only 2 built-in methods to be called on tuples - index() and count()

Lists - better for performing operations like insertions/deletions.
Tuples - better for operations like accessing thee elements.

Lists - elements are enclosed in []
Tuples - elements are enclosed in ()

Lists - will create new list when copied using list() i,e. Lists can be copied
Tuple - wont create a new copy when co=opied using tuple() i,e. Tuples cannot be copied

Lists - Cannot be used as Key in Dictionary since Key should be Mutable.
Tuple: Can be used as Key in Dictionary, since it is Immutable.
